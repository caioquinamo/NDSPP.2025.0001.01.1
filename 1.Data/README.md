## Dataset Access

This project relies on a dataset that is accessible through multiple channels, depending on the user's preferences and working environment. The available options are outlined below:

---

### 1. Kaggle (Original source)

The dataset was originally obtained from **Kaggle**, a widely recognized platform known for its reliability and wealth of data science content.  
It serves as the official source, ensuring the dataset's authenticity.  
It is recommended to review the original description and usage conditions.

### 2. Execute the Notebook (automatic download)

When the project's notebook is executed on a local machine, no manual dataset download is required.  
The code includes an automated function that retrieves the dataset from Google Drive using `gdown`.  
The file is saved directly in the same directory as the notebook, with no additional steps needed.  
This method allows immediate access to the data for analysis.  
It only requires the `gdown` library to be installed (`pip install gdown`).

### 3. Direct download from Google Drive

The dataset is also available for direct download from Google Drive.  
This is useful for those who only want the `.csv` file without cloning the repository or running any code.  
It is the same file used by the notebook.  
The download is public, direct, and does not require authentication.
